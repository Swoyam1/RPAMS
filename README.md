# Remotely Piloted Aircraft Management System (RPAMS):
Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) Management System is a real- time system that maintains the information of all the registered
RPAs (commonly termed as Drones), like real-time GPS location of
the device along with their owner details and also tracks the devices to ensure that the devices are not flying in the no-fly
zones. This system allows the user to register their RPAs and get
permission to fly their RPAs legally even in limited-fly zones using
an interactive web interface
